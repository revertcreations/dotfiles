# dotfiles
Here you will find my somewhat untidy and ever evolving configuration files. I have many machines including: MacOS, Ubuntu, Arch, PopOS!, and even Windows (gotta get gaming on somehow!)

## vim
ViM is my preferred editor, thought I have spend many professional hours in Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, and even some PHPStorm. This config is using the best colortheme Gruvbox, and is mostly set up for fullstack Javascript development.

## tmux
I live in tmux, and have a few tweaks to some keybindings, but it's largely defualt settings with some Gruvbox styling of course.

## alacritty
I have been using alacritty as my main terminal for the past 3-4 years now. I believe I need to commit my .yaml config

## pull requests
If you see something in here that is just totally messed up or the wrong way of doing, feel free to pull request!
